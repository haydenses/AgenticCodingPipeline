# Intro

To use this program with ease, go to the streamlit website listed below

i used a google api key to configure this project since it can be generated for free and it has 25 free uses with the code 

to use this program though, a minimum of 4 agents will be invoked, meaning you can have around 6 tries per day of this program, if the agents are all only called once


# generating a key and using the website:

to generate a key to use it in the website, go to https://aistudio.google.com/ and create an account

then generate an api key through their website website by going to the dashboard, clicking create api key at the top right, and creating that key

the key will be a really long name that you will need to paste into the website

i should also note that when you enter the key, it is stored locally on your ram in the browser tab, not on the website or anything adjacent to the website
